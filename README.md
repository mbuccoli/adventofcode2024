# adventofcode2024

## Intro
Just another repo of a white straight guy trying to solve  advent of code for 24 days straight.

## Journal
### Day 1
Easy peasy, but I had to redefine numpy's "fromstring" as the documentation looked unclear and it was easier to redo than debug.

On a second thought, implementing everything as a class would have been easier to keep the intermediate outputs, but the solution is clean enough to me.
TBH I'm not sure I'll keep such nice docstring also for future solutions, today is a Sunday, tomorrow I'll do that during lunch break.


## Who am I
My name is Michele Buccoli, I am not a developer. My job is not coding, but it involves coding. Actually, as a senior scientist at BdSound, my job involves reviewing other people's code (poteto potato tometo tomato).
You can learn other info on myself and contact me through my website mbuccoli.github.io .
